Please update the child theme too:

2) If you have the "functions.php" file in your child theme, copy the php code from the "Child Theme/ib-educator-child/functions.php" into your child theme's "functions.php".

3) If you don't have the "functions.php" in your child theme, then just copy the "Child Theme/ib-educator-child/functions.php" to your child theme's directory.

4) Delete the following line from the "style.css" in your child theme:
@import url('../ib-educator/style.css');
